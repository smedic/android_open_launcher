This is a Open-Launcher-for-GTV, project by Entertailion.
I have made a migration from Eclipse build to Gradle and fixed a few compatability issues. 

I want to customize it for my purposes.

Open-Launcher-for-GTV
=====================

<p>The ultimate Google TV launcher. The Open Launcher app is an alternative to the default home launcher app provided by Google TV. The app is published as a free app in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.entertailion.android.launcher">Google Play Store</a> or you can <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17958951/Open-Launcher-for-GTV.apk">download</a> it directly.</p>
